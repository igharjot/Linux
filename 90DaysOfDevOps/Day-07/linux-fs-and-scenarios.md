# Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy & Scenario-Based Practice

# PART-1: Linux Directory Structure – Practice Notes (DevOps Focus)

## Core Directories (Must Know)

### `/` (root)
- **What it contains:** The top-level directory; every file and folder in Linux exists under this directory.
- **Observed from `ls -l /`:** `bin`, `boot`, `dev`, `etc`
- **I would use this when…** I need to understand the overall filesystem structure or access system-level directories.

---

### `/home`
- **What it contains:** Home directories for all normal users where personal files and configurations are stored.
- **Observed from `ls -l /home`:** `harjot`, `ubuntu`
- **I would use this when…** I’m working with user files, projects, or personal environment configurations.

---

### `/root`
- **What it contains:** The home directory of the root (administrator) user.
- **Observed from `ls -l /root`:** `.bashrc`, `.ssh`
- **I would use this when…** I’m logged in as root and performing administrative tasks.

---

### `/etc`
- **What it contains:** System-wide configuration files for services and the operating system.
- **Observed from `ls -l /etc`:** `passwd`, `ssh`
- **I would use this when…** I need to configure users, services, networking, or system settings.

---

### `/var/log`
- **What it contains:** Log files generated by the system and running services.
- **Observed from `ls -l /var/log`:** `syslog`, `auth.log`
- **I would use this when…** I’m troubleshooting errors, service failures, or security-related issues.

---

### `/tmp`
- **What it contains:** Temporary files created by applications and the system.
- **Observed from `ls -l /tmp`:** `systemd-private-*`
- **I would use this when…** I need short-lived storage that is automatically cleaned by the system.

---

## Additional Directories (Good to Know)

### `/bin`
- **What it contains:** Essential command binaries required for system boot and basic operations.
- **Observed from `ls -l /bin`:** `ls`, `cp`
- **I would use this when…** I need access to basic commands, especially in recovery or minimal environments.

---

### `/usr/bin`
- **What it contains:** User-level command binaries and most commonly used utilities.
- **Observed from `ls -l /usr/bin`:** `git`, `python3`
- **I would use this when…** I’m running normal user commands and development tools.

---

### `/opt`
- **What it contains:** Optional or third-party applications installed manually.
- **Observed from `ls -l /opt`:** `google`, `oracle`
- **I would use this when…** I install custom or third-party software outside the default package manager.

## Quick Mapping

- **Configuration files:** `/etc`
- **Log files:** `/var/log`
- **Essential binaries:** `/bin`
- **User binaries:** `/usr/bin`
- **User data:** `/home`
- **Temporary data:** `/tmp`

## Scenario - Check if a service is running.
